- Dart SDK (version 3.0 or higher)
- A Binance account with API access

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binance_panic_button.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```

## üîë Setting Up Binance API Keys

1. Log in to your Binance account
2. Navigate to API Management (under your profile)
3. Create a new API key
4. **Important**: Enable trading permissions for your API key
5. For security reasons, it's recommended to:
   - Restrict API access to specific IP addresses
   - Disable withdrawal permissions
   - Enable 2FA on your Binance account

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Your API keys are stored securely using Flutter Secure Storage with encryption
- The app never stores your keys on a remote server
- API keys are only used for trading operations, not withdrawals
- Consider using Binance Testnet first to verify the app's functionality

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Login**: Enter your Binance API and Secret keys
2. **Select Stablecoin**: Choose which stablecoin you want to convert your assets to
3. **View Balances**: See your current asset holdings
4. **Panic Sell**: When needed, press the red "PANIC SELL ALL ASSETS" button
5. **Review Results**: Check which assets were sold successfully and which weren't

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The app performs market sells, which may result in slippage during high volatility
- Some assets might not have direct trading pairs with your selected stablecoin
- The app will attempt to sell through BTC as an intermediary when direct pairs aren't available
- Small balances might be skipped due to Binance's minimum trade size requirements

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **API Connection Issues**: Verify your API keys and ensure they have trading permissions
- **Failed Transactions**: Check if the trading pair exists or if you have sufficient balance
- **Network Errors**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection
